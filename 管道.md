##  Construction

管道由以下五个部分组成:

  1. 一个物品源。这既可以是一个拥有物品栏的方块也可以是一个CraftBook的或者其他插件提供的可以实现物品输出的方块。 
  2. 一个黏性活塞和一个为活塞提供红石脉冲的物品。原理就像"水泵"一样可以将物品抽出。拥有输出能力的集成电路不需要红石脉冲来抽出，但是必须将其对准方块的输出口。
  3. A tube of a pipe block to act as the actual pipe. This connects from the pump to the input device. 
  4. A normal piston that acts as an input device. It should be facing what it will be putting items into. This can input items into some IC's. The input source of an IC is always the sign. 
  5. Somewhere to put items, it can be an IC with inputs; or a container. 
  6. A filter sign attached to either the input or output piston (or both), more info below. 

###  Filtering

To filter pipes, just place a sign on the either sticky or normal piston, with
the following text on it:

  1. Blank 
  2. [Pipe] 
  3. ID's to include, seperated by commas. Eg, "1,4,5:2" to only pipe stone, cobble and birch wood. 
  4. ID's to exclude, seperated by commas. Eg, "1,4,5:2" will pipe everything BUT stone, cobble and birch wood. 

If the configuration option 'pipes require signs' is enabled, these signs are
required on pipes for them to function. This is useful for making pipes
require permissions to be created.

###  Insulation

If pipes are allowed to connect diagonally (Configurable in config), they have
the ability to be insulated. Insulation means that if the designated insulator
block is between every possible diagonal connection of 2 tube blocks, they
will not connect. By default, the insulation block is wool.

###  Tube Types

####  Basic Glass Tubes

Normal glass is a standard tube block. This will transfer any items piped into
it, and will conduct to any type of tube.

####  Stained Glass Tubes

Stained glass tubes are very similar to normal glass tubes, however, stained
glass will only conduct to stained glass of the same colour, or normal glass.

####  Basic Glass Pane

Glass panes will only conduct in a straight line. For example, with this you
could make a crossover pipe, that allows for compact usage of multiple pipes
crossing over. This allows any type of tube to conduct it, both stained and
normal glass blocks.

####  Stained Glass Pane

These work the same way as normal glass panes, but will only conduct glass of
the same colour, or normal glass.

##  Permissions

Permission Node  Effect

craftbook.circuits.pipes

Allows for the creation of pipe signs.

##  Configuration

Configuration Node and Path  Default Value  Effect

circuits.pipes.enable

false

Enables the pipe mechanic.

circuits.pipes.allow-diagonal

false

Allow pipes to work diagonally. Required for insulators to work.

circuits.pipes.insulator-block

WOOL

When pipes work diagonally, this block allows the pipe to be insulated to not
work diagonally.

circuits.pipes.stack-per-move

true

This option stops the pipes taking the entire chest on power, and makes it
just take a single stack.

circuits.pipes.require-sign

false

Requires pipes to have a [Pipe] sign connected to them. This is the only way
to require permissions to make pipes.
